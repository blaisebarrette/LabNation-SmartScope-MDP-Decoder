# Getting started

## Getting the files

Clone the repository

Generate the Visual Studio project files by running ```protobuild.exe```

## Writing a decoder

* Open the solution 
	* On Windows, this is done by double-clicking the .sln file, which was generated by protobuild in the previous step
* Add your own **Class library** project, i.e. *MyDecoders*.
	* In Visual Studio, this is done by right-clicking your solution (top line in the Solution Explorer at the top-right of your screen) and selecting Add -> New Project
	* In the forthcoming dialog, make sure Visual C# is selected on the left, which should allow you to select Class Library on the right
	* Give a meaningful name (eg MyDecoders) to you class, using the Name field at the bottom of the dialog.
* Add the following references:
1)	LabNationInterfaces 
2)	System.ComponentModel.Composition
	* In your solution explorer at the top-right of your screen, find your newly added project (eg MyDecoders) and right-click on the References entry underneath it. Select Add Reference.
	* Go to Solutions -> Projects to find the first reference
		* Make sure you put a tick before the assembly, or it will not be added!
	* Go to Assemblies for the second one
	* Verify that these 2 newly added references have been added to the list of References of the MyDeocders project!

* Last but not least, write your decoder

}
```

## Build and use

Build the project

Copy the output DLL from the build directory (i.e. ```./MyDecoders/bin/Debug/MyDecoders.dll```) to ```<My Documents>/LabNation/Plugins```

Restart the SmartScope app and enjoy your decoder

## DLL location
Our approach allows a DLL file compiled on any platform, to be used on any other platform. So a DLL file compiled on Windows can be used on iOS. Just make sure the DLL is placed in the correct folder, listed below:

| Platform        | Path          | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Mac           | ```/Users/<username>/LabNation/Plugins``` |
| Linux         | ```~/LabNation/Plugins```                 |
| Windows       | ```<My Documents>/LabNation/Plugins```    |
| Android       | ```<sd-card>/LabNation/Plugins```         |
| iOS           | See section below regarding DropBox       |

## Fetch DLL over DropBox
For all platforms, you can access a DLL file over DropBox. To do so, in the app go to Menu -> Add decoder -> Fetch from dropbox. If never done before, this will authenticate to DropBox and create all folders required. Next, on your PC you can save the DLL file to \Dropbox\Apps\LabNation SmartScope\Plugins. All DLL files you place here can now be accessed from all your devices over dropbox!
